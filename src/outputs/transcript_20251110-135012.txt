Text: The Swagger Docs, the way it's set up is there's a lot of systems that will be just and use it as input, so that you, if you're doing a lot of API stuff, you can't use it. The last one that I've seen a lot of people start to use right now is Jupiter Books. People are using Jupiter Books for auto-docs. They're using it less in context of software projects, but more in context of the GGC and projects, so if I was going to write the high torch system that was analyzed in a way, I might just read it. So how do auto-docs work? So the way that auto-docs work is auto-docs are generally another form of static analysis, in other words they reach your code and make decisions. So the way normally works is you will have your source code. You're going to set it templates.
