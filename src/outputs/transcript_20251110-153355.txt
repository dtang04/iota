Text: is usually through this memory map to IO in some hardware queue that keeps track of messages going out and in. And then you might read the messages back in by reading some special memory locations like I'm expecting a message. I read this location, what do you got for it? So that sort of help, this tends to work. And pretty much all these machines that we'll study have a mechanism sort of like this, typically. There are ways to try to move this.
