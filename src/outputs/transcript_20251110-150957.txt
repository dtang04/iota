Text: It takes to run without parallelism on a machine, for example, that can only run one thing at a time, sort of one task at a time. That machine might use these things, like winding an ILP, but you're just sort of running one sort of task or program, not really very of like function at a time in your code. And then the speed up is how much faster what's the factor of being faster, the speed up factor, in terms of how fast it takes to run on your parallel machine versus how fast on your machine. And you can see, right, this is the slower one, so this is the bigger number. This is the smaller number. Ideally, you take this and you break it up into some pieces, and you're dividing by that number of pieces, essentially, ideally, and that's the factor of being. So there's an option, I was called my deal speed up. And that is M, or M. So if you build a machine back and run and things at a time, if you take your work and you divide it into N perfectly even pieces, without adding any extra work to make it work, which is what we have to do. Then ideally, it would be N times faster. So that. And so when we look at this, we look at the number of processors, so N times the server of processors. And we look at the speed up, right? Ideal speed up is sometimes called linear speed up, which basically means it's always equal to N. So for however many 10 processors, the speed up is 10, it's 20, it's 20. And so the ideal version of this of our goal with parallel computing is to have behavior like this. Now in reality, it probably looks something like this. So realistic speed up tends to fall off. And I'll tell you an example of why that is the case. But generally speaking, it has to do with the fact that when you break things up into N pieces, number one, they might not be equal pieces. And that's going to cause problems. And also, when you break things up in N pieces, sometimes they need to talk to each other. And that's extra work. But this one didn't have to coordinate between N and this is only one piece, right? One in competition. And if you have in competitions, there might be some amount of communication. So they're 10 to 10.

Summary (llama3):
Summary:
- Here is the summary:
- • The transcript discusses parallel computing and how it can speed up processing time on a machine with multiple processors.
- • The ideal scenario for parallel computing is to divide work into N perfectly even pieces, resulting in an N-fold increase in speed.
- • However, realistic scenarios often deviate from this ideal due to factors such as unequal piece sizes and the need for communication between pieces.
