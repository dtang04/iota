Text: into our HTML website which is going to be showing to us. And we have a lot of different options here. So what I don't know every one of these options, I kind of play around with them to see exactly which one I like. The docks, string sections, style, spacey. It's a pretty nice one. But there are other ones. So to see. We can table or list. So this is the spacey one. It looks like this. We can do list style, which will look like this. And we do table side style, which will look like this. Which one do you like? Let's do it full with the files. Do you like the table style? Do you like the list style? 3, 4, 5, 6 boats. Then you like spacey. And 2, 3, 4, 5 of spacey is the last. All right, list it is. Or second one. So we'll do do docks, string, section, style, and all good works. So now we go to our basketball area. Now we're going to go to the cool bars, which is the API docs. Everything we've done so far is really boring in my fight. It's just taking static markdown files, entering a DHTML. We've all written DHTML. You can find another one in those slides. You can already play on code, and you turn markdown to DHTML. It's not that exciting. But the API docs are where things get really exciting. Which is the API docs are going to parse through all of our source code. And it's going to generate website to generate information based on the comments. So what we have here is our API documentation. We have our college routes. College API routes definition. Handlers. And we have our first route, which is list colleges. This will retrieve all colleges from the database. And it will return a JSON response to pool. And amazingly, we have a link already directly to the code. So we can see what it looks like. And you can see that we just have already just created this. It's been done for us. So where is it getting this stuff from? It's getting it from the source code itself. So let's go to the source code and see what I can verify. So I've got an API college.
