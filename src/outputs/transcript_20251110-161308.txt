Text: And then you just know where they are. And what you have to do is force them to wait. It's a little bit like your pipeline manager. It's like the data is moving through all the data paths. And then you have to stop it and synchronize it. So the same thing. All of these are just running freely. And at some point in the program, you want to know everyone's gotten to that point in the program. You have to sync it. Now, we will study different ways of synchronization. The simplest way is just point to point. When you set a message, that means that maybe this one's going to be waiting for this. The easiest way to think of it is actually what's called barrier synchronization, which is... You just make everyone wait out of particular...

Summary (llama3):
Summary:
- • The speaker discusses the concept of forcing data to wait and synchronizing it in a program.
- • This process is compared to pipeline management, where data flows through different paths and needs to be stopped and synchronized at certain points.
- • The speaker mentions studying different ways of synchronization, including point-to-point and barrier synchronization.
